# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Pyber Analysis
A ride-sharing summary presented in a DataFrame by city type
A summary of total weekly fares for each city type presented in a multiple-line chart 

## Purpose
Use analysis to determine average number of fare, drivers, and riders by type of city, and percentage of total fares, drivers and riders by type of city. This will help Pyber improve access to rideshare services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Resources
Data Source: Pyber_ride_date.csv, city_data.csv, ride_date.csv
Software: Python 3.9.0, Anaconda 4.9.1, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas 1.2.3

# Results
## How does the data differ by city type? How can those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer?
